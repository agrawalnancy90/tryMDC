# tryMDC
Backend:
This requires Spring Framework.
Default Port Number is 8080 for the backend server.

Frontend:
Install Project Dependencies and Start Server
1. Open command line and go to material-components-web-codelabs/mdc-102/starter directory
2. Run: npm install
3. Install MDC Web Components: npm install material-components-web
4. npm install @material/typography@1.0.0
5. Run: npm start 
6. In your browser go to URL "http://localhost:8081". Please check the port number in your terminal output when you do npm start. Usually it is 8080. "Project is running at http://localhost:8081/"

Note: Since front-end consumes results from the REST API exposed by spring framework, you need to run that first.
